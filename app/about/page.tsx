          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Since its inception in 2009, the Department of Electrical & Electronic
            Engineering (EEE) at <strong>Atish Dipankar University of Science and
            Technology (ADUST)</strong> has established itself as a dynamic academic
            and professional platform dedicated to excellence in engineering
            education, research, and innovation. The department has continuously
            evolved to align its academic vision with global technological progress
            while remaining deeply responsive to national development priorities.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The EEE curriculum at ADUST is designed to build a strong foundation in
            fundamental sciences and their practical applications across power
            engineering, electronics, telecommunications, communication systems,
            computing architecture, and emerging interdisciplinary domains.
            Emphasis is placed on analytical thinking, system-level design, and
            problem-solving skills, enabling graduates to design and implement
            engineering solutions that are relevant both locally and
            internationally.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            A defining strength of the Department of EEE is its forward-looking
            academic philosophy, aimed at producing 21st-century engineers capable
            of leading in an era shaped by the Fourth Industrial Revolution
            (Industry 4.0). Through outcome-based education, modern laboratory
            facilities, research-oriented teaching, and industry-aligned learning,
            the department prepares students to address complex engineering
            challenges that influence socio-economic development at national and
            global scales.
          </p>
